## 🖼️ **STUDENT WORKS & TESTIMONIALS (生徒作品・感想)**

This page showcases:

- Gallery of student works across multiple categories (character modeling, robots, castles, etc.)
- Testimonials with personal stories from students about value & clarity of instruction

---

## 🎓 **FREE MATERIALS (無料教材)**

- Examples of basic wireframes (frog, snake, cat, dog)

This section functions as both lead magnet + onboarding content.

---

## 💻 **SUPPORT / UTILITY PAGES**

### Maya Install Instructions

- Static instructions telling students how to install Autodesk Maya for the course (likely linking to official Autodesk site downloads)

### Zoom Install Instructions

- Simple page explaining Zoom is required to join live sessions post-registration

### Contact & Cancel

- Contact form page
- Cancel/refund process page (minimal)

---

## 🔍 **CONTENT STYLE & POSITIONING**

### Audience Messaging

The site positions itself as:

- Accessible to total beginners
- A bridge to professional CG knowledge
- Personal guidance rather than impersonal videos
- Remote learning (live and recorded)

### Tone

- Encouraging (“you _can_ discover your talent”)
- Structured step-by-step course progression
- Emphasis on instructor credibility

There’s _no brand design system_, typography is default, and layout is basic blocks — typical of a legacy Jimdo site.

## 🎯 **STRUCTURAL / TECH ISSUES (REFRESH CRITICAL)**

### ❌ Current Weaknesses

- Static HTML with minimal styling
- No responsive layout (likely not mobile optimized)
- Payments are manual, not automated
- No structured database for classes or students
- Heavy text, poor visual hierarchy
- No consistent branding or design language
- Basic gallery with no filters or categorization

### ❌ UX Problems

- Too many menu items that don’t need separate pages (e.g., Zoom install)
- No clear path for conversion (besides Google Form)
- No emphasis on instructor credibility beyond text
- Hard for new users to understand course progression

---

## 📈 **STRATEGIC CONTENT DETAILS**

### Instructor

The teacher, **糸数 弘樹 (Hiroki Itokazu)**, claims practical industry experience and teaching experience — though not clearly emphasized on current home page.

External context (from press/interviews) shows he has worked in the CG industry and aims to teach CG online from the U.S. to Japan.
